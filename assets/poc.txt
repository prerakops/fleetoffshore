Hi team,
My name is Prerak and I am from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.
I recently came across few companies which provides the whatsapp number database, it has more than few crores of whatsapp numbers.
I will be soon starting a business which will have whatsapp interactions. I would like to know if I can get such a huge database access directly from WhatsApp instead of 3rd party providers.
